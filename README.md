For creating the DMG, run this command:
./scripts/build_and_sign.sh

- When asked "Apply quarantine attribute to DMG for local testing? (y/n)",
  if you want to test if this can be installed on other macs then choose "y" and install it on your mac - this would simulate fresh installation as in a new mac.
