"Heavy reliance on boxed groupings feels more iOS/mobile than native macOS.",
"Text hierarchy is flat; section headers and body text lack distinct weight differentiation.",
"Input fields span the full width, creating excessive white space and reducing readability."

"top_fixes": [
"Remove gray background containers; use whitespace and standard dividers to separate sections.",
"Increase font weight for section headers (e.g., Semibold) and ensure proper spacing (20pt+).",
"Constrain input field widths to a reasonable maximum and align generic actions (like buttons) to the left or right consistently."
